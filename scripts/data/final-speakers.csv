The Sehmat team has spent five years with the middle-aged women of tribal communities and observed how sexuality can be delivered in context of the community and not from our lens of “regift” and “wrong, “appropriate” and “inappropriate” behaviours.

It begins not with explanation, but with experience. For the first 40 minutes, participants will enter a carefully designed space — an immersive environment curated to evoke sensory, emotional, and symbolic connection. Through sound, scent, and subtle ritual, they will be invited to surrender to an alternate reality crafted by the facilitator, experiencing firsthand how space, intention, and embodied awareness can transform perception.

Following this immersive opening, participants gather in a reflection circle to process their embodied experience—noticing what shifted, what they became aware of, and how the facilitation choices influenced their state. This bridges into a conceptual segment where we examine the neuroscience and philosophy underlying embodied learning: how ritual creates psychological safety, how sensory cues bypass cognitive resistance, and how the facilitator's presence functions as a co-regulator in group learning. 

We'll explore practical frameworks for integrating these elements—examining language patterns, spatial arrangement, breath, and micro-rituals that can be woven into various contexts. The session closes with open dialogue, inviting participants to consider how their own cultural backgrounds, bodies, and beliefs shape their facilitation, and how they might honor that more consciously. Participants leave with a simple design framework and 2-3 immediately applicable techniques for bringing embodied awareness into their work—whether teaching in classrooms, leading corporate training, or facilitating community gatherings.

This presentation explores Experience Design as the intentional architecture behind powerful experience-based training. Moving beyond “learning by doing,” Experience Design focuses on crafting immersive journeys that engage participants cognitively, emotionally, and behaviourally, turning moments of participation into moments of transformation.

Drawing from the principles of Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle, design thinking, and theatre-based pedagogy, this interactive session unpacks the how of designing learning experiences, that truly matter. Participants will step into the role of “experience architects,” exploring how to shape environments, emotions, and interactions that generate insight and behavioural change. Through live micro-activities, short design challenges, and reflective dialogue, attendees will learn how to build the arc of experience: from initial curiosity and tension, through discovery, to integration and application.

The session also demonstrates how Experience Design principles apply across diverse contexts, from corporate leadership and healthcare training to intercultural education and community development. Participants will leave with a practical Experience Design Canvas and a clear framework for crafting their own transformative experiences.

Expect to be immersed rather than instructed. Together, we will explore how every sensory cue, emotional moment, and structured reflection can be intentionally designed to create learning that lasts—learning that not only informs but transforms.

But what if the real method is who we are while doing it? et, most of these reflections stay in the head. We think about presence instead of feeling it. This workshop invites educators and facilitators to explore that question through a different doorway — the body.

Embodied facilitation recognizes that our body, breath, and nervous system constantly communicate, often before words or methods do. How we stand, breathe, look, and listen shapes the emotional tone of a learning space more deeply than any technique. In this session, participants will explore three movements of awareness. First, awareness of self — noticing how our body holds us while facilitating, and how tension, posture, or energy reflects our inner stance. Second, awareness of the relational field — sensing the subtle exchanges between our body and the group’s collective state. Finally, presence as method,  shifting from performing facilitation to inhabiting it, moving from managing to truly being with the group.

This 90-minute session is gentle, reflective, and experiential. There is no strenuous activity, only space to pause, notice, and sense. Participants will leave with a felt understanding of how presence itself can be facilitation and how awareness, rather than effort, becomes the heart of leading groups.",www.linkedin.com/in/zuhailbabu 31st Jan ,4.00,5.30,Yateen Gharat,"Yateen Gharat is the CEO of Pro-Fac Professional Facilitators and MD at Outdoor Adventure Management.
